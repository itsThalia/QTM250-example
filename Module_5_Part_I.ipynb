Rather than creating trajectories in series (as we did for the one-dimensional random walk in class), create a program that will update the positions of multiple particles at each time step. Within your code, create a binary array that identifies which particles have reached the boundary (1 if yes, 0 if no). Store x and y positions in 2d arrays, and only update the positions of particles that are not on the boundary. For particles that are on the boundary, positions should be the same as the previous time step. This will be useful for the next steps.**"
